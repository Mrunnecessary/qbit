<h1>Qbit — Investor Overview</h1>
<p><strong>Tagline:</strong> AI that shows its thinking</p>

<hr>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
As AI becomes more capable, users increasingly struggle to <em>trust</em> its outputs.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>AI answers hide assumptions and uncertainty</li>
  <li>Conflicting information is collapsed into one response</li>
  <li>Users cannot understand <em>why</em> an answer was given</li>
  <li>AI outputs are disposable and cannot be reused meaningfully</li>
</ul>

<h2>Insight</h2>
<p>
The next challenge in AI is not generating better answers —  
it is helping humans <strong>understand and decide</strong> with confidence.
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
Qbit is a reasoning-first AI system designed to make thinking transparent.
</p>
<p>
Instead of rushing to answers, Qbit:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Makes assumptions explicit</li>
  <li>Separates known facts from unknowns</li>
  <li>Shows multiple valid perspectives</li>
  <li>Explains reasoning step by step</li>
  <li>Keeps humans in control of final decisions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Product Vision</h2>
<p>
Qbit is building the <strong>thinking layer for the AI era</strong>.
</p>
<p>
As AI models and agents become more powerful, Qbit sits upstream —  
helping users reason clearly <em>before</em> actions are taken.
</p>
<p>
The product is intentionally model-agnostic and designed to remain relevant
as the AI ecosystem evolves.
</p>

<h2>Target Users (Initial Focus)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Knowledge workers making non-trivial decisions</li>
  <li>Founders and professionals evaluating trade-offs</li>
  <li>Users who value clarity over speed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Business Model</h2>
<p>
Qbit follows a capital-efficient SaaS model:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Individual subscriptions for advanced reasoning features</li>
  <li>Professional plans for reuse and decision history</li>
</ul>
<p>
Low infrastructure costs allow profitability with a relatively small paid user base.
</p>

<h2>Defensibility Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Structured decision frameworks</li>
<li>User feedback learning loop</li>
<li>Retention-driven product design</li>
<li>Positioning as clarity layer in AI ecosystem</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Early Traction</h2>
<ul>
<li>20 users on early-access waitlist</li>
<li>Direct founder-user feedback loop active</li>
<li>Retention-focused MVP in progress</li>
</ul>
