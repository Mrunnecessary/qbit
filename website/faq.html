<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>
Qbit is built to help people think clearly and make informed decisions.
Below are answers to the most common questions.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What is Qbit?</h2>
<p>
Qbit is a reasoning-first AI that helps you understand how answers are formed.
Instead of only giving results, it shows assumptions, uncertainty, and multiple perspectives
so you can decide with clarity.
</p>

<h2>How is Qbit different from ChatGPT or other AI tools?</h2>
<p>
Most AI tools focus on producing fast and confident answers.
Qbit focuses on transparent thinking — explaining <em>why</em> an answer exists,
what it assumes, and where it may be uncertain.
</p>

<h2>Does Qbit give the “right” answer?</h2>
<p>
Qbit does not claim a single “right” answer.
It helps surface different viewpoints and trade-offs so you can make the final decision yourself.
</p>

<h2>Who is Qbit for?</h2>
<p>
Qbit is designed for people who value clarity over speed, especially when decisions matter.
It is well suited for professionals, founders, learners, and anyone dealing with complex or
conflicting information.
</p>

<h2>Is Qbit free?</h2>
<p>
Qbit is currently in early access.

</p>

<h2>Does Qbit store my data or conversations?</h2>
<p>

and improve the experience. We do not sell or share personal data.
More details are available in our Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>Is Qbit an AI agent that takes actions on my behalf?</h2>
<p>
No. Qbit is intentionally human-in-the-loop.
It helps you think and decide, but it does not execute actions for you.
</p>

<h2>Can I use Qbit for work, study, or research?</h2>
<p>
Yes. Qbit is especially useful when you need to understand complex topics,
compare viewpoints, or explain reasoning clearly to others.
</p>

<p>
Early users are encouraged to share feedback via email or feedback forms.
Your input directly influences how Qbit evolves.
</p>

<h2>When will new features be added?</h2>

Qbit prioritizes clarity and trust over rapid feature expansion.
